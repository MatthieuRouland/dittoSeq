\arguments{
\item{vars}{String vector (example: \code{c("gene1","gene2","gene3")}) which selects which variables, typically genes, to extract from the object, summarize across groups, and add to the plot}

\item{object}{A Seurat, SingleCellExperiment, or \linkS4class{RNAseq} object, or the name of the object in "quotes". REQUIRED, unless \code{DEFAULT <- "object"} has been run.}

\item{group.by}{String representing the name of a "metadata" to use for separating the cells/samples into discrete groups. REQUIRED.}

\item{color.by}{String representing the name of a "metadata" to use for setting color.
Affects boxplot, vlnplot, and ridgeplot fills.
Note: For \code{color.by} to be utilized, all \code{group.by} groupings must match to a single \code{color.by} grouping.}

\item{summary.fxn}{A function which sets how variables' data will be summarized accross the groups.
Default is \code{\link{mean}}, which will take the average value, but any function can be used as long as it takes in a numeric vector and returns a single numeric value.
Alternative examles: \code{\link{median}}, \code{\link{max}}.}

\item{cells.use}{String vector of cells'/samples' names which should be included.
Alternatively, a Logical vector, the same length as the number of cells in the object, which sets which cells to include.
For the typically easier logical method, provide \code{USE} in \code{object@cell.names[USE]} OR \code{colnames(object)[USE]}).}

\item{plots}{String vector which sets the types of plots to include: possibilities = "jitter", "boxplot", "vlnplot", "ridgeplot". See details section for more info.}

\item{data.type}{String which sets the data slot/representation used for obtaining gene expression data with the \code{\link{gene}} function.
DEFAULT = "relative", which will then utilize normalized data z-scores, but any options available within \code{\link{gene}} work.}

\item{do.hover}{Logical. Default = \code{FALSE}.
If set to \code{TRUE} the object will be converted to a ggplotly object so that data about individual points will be displayed when you hover your cursor over them.
The hover data works best for jitter data representations, so it is recommended to have \code{"jitter"} as the last value of the \code{plots} input when running using hover.

Note: Currently, incompatible with RidgePlots as plotly does not support the geom.}

\item{main}{String which sets the plot title.}

\item{sub}{String which sets the plot subtitle.}

\item{ylab}{String which sets the y axis label.
Default = a combination of then name of the summary function + \code{data.type} (which is changed to "z-score" if as "relative") + "expression".
Set to \code{NULL} to remove.}

\item{y.breaks}{Numeric vector, a set of breaks that should be used as major gridlines. c(break1,break2,break3,etc.).}

\item{min, max}{Scalars which control the zoom of the plot.
These inputs set the minimum / maximum values of the data to show.
Default = set based on the limits of the data in var.}

\item{xlab}{String which sets the x axis label, default is \code{group.by}.}

\item{x.labels}{String vector, c("label1","label2","label3",...) which overrides the names of the samples/groups.  NOTE: you need to give at least as many labels as there are discrete values in the group.by data.}

\item{x.labels.rotate}{Logical which sets whether the labels should be rotated.
Default: \code{TRUE} for violin and box plots, but \code{FALSE} for ridgeplots.}

\item{x.reorder}{Integer vector. A sequence of numbers, from 1 to the number of groupings, for rearranging the order of x-axis groupings.

Method: Make a first plot without this input.
Then, treating the leftmost grouping as index 1, and the rightmost as index n.
Values of x.reorder should be these indices, but in the order that you would like them rearranged to be.}

\item{color.panel}{String vector which sets the colors to draw from. \code{dittoColors()} by default.}

\item{colors}{Integer vector, the indexes / order, of colors from color.panel to actually use}

\item{theme}{ggplot theme. Allows setting of a base theme. Default = \code{theme_classic()} when nothing is provided. \code{theme_bw()} is another great option.}

\item{jitter.size}{Scalar which sets the size of the jitter shapes.}

\item{jitter.width}{Scalar that sets the width/spread of the jitter in the x direction. Ignored in ridgeplots.}

\item{jitter.color}{String which sets the color of the jitter shapes.}

\item{boxplot.width}{Scalar which sets the width/spread of the boxplot in the x direction}

\item{boxplot.color}{String which sets the color of the lines of the boxplot}

\item{boxplot.show.outliers}{Logical, whether outliers should by including in the boxplot.
Default is \code{FALSE} when there is a jitter plotted, \code{TRUE} if there is no jitter.}

\item{boxplot.fill}{Logical, whether the boxplot should be filled in or not.}

\item{vlnplot.lineweight}{Scalar which sets the thickness of the line that outlines the violin plots.}

\item{vlnplot.width}{Scalar which sets the width/spread of the jitter in the x direction}

\item{vlnplot.scaling}{String which sets how the widths of the of violin plots are set in relation to eachother.
Options are "area", "count", and "width". If the deafult is not right for your data, I recommend trying "width".
For a detailed explanation of each, see \code{\link{geom_violin}}.}

\item{ridgeplot.lineweight}{Scalar which sets the thickness of the ridgeplot outline.}

\item{ridgeplot.scale}{Scalar which sets the distance/overlap between ridgeplots.
A value of 1 means the tallest density curve just touches the baseline of the next higher one.
Higher numbers lead to greater overlap.  Default = 1.25}

\item{add.line}{numeric value(s) where a dashed horizontal line should go}

\item{line.linetype}{String which sets the type of line.  Any ggplot linetype should work.  Defaults to "dashed"}

\item{line.color}{String that sets the color(s) of the horizontal line(s)}

\item{legend.show}{Logical. Whether the legend should be displayed. Default = \code{TRUE}.}

\item{legend.title}{String or \code{NULL}, sets the title for the main legend. It is set to \code{NULL} (off) by default.}

\item{data.out}{Logical which sets whether just the plot should be output, or a list containing the plot (\code{p}) and data (\code{data}).  Note: plotly output is turned off in this setting, but hover.data is still calculated.}
}
\value{
A ggplot, plotly, or list containing the plot and underlying data as a data.table.
Generally, This function will output a dittoPlot, grouped by sample, age, cluster, etc., where each data point represents the summary (typically \code{mean}), accross each group, of individual variables.  Variables can be genes or metadata.
}
\description{
Generates a dittoPlot where datapoints are genes/metadata summarizes per groups instead of individual values per cells/samples.
}
\details{
The data for each variable (a.k.a. each element of \code{vars}) is obtained.
If elements are gene names, \code{data.type} is utilized to determine what representation of the data to use.
x-axis groupings are then determined using \code{group.by}.
For all cells/samples in each grouping, the data for each variable is summarized using the \code{summary.fxn}.
Finally, data is plotted with data representations types based on the contents of \code{plots}.

If \code{do.hover=TRUE}, underlying data is retrieved and displayed upon hovering the cursor over a jitter point.

If \code{data.out=TRUE}, a list is returned that contains two elements: the plot (\code{$p}), and data.table (\code{$data}) containing the underlying data for each variable summary for each grouping.

The \code{plots} argument determines the types of data representation that will be generated, as well as their order from back to front.
Options are \code{"jitter"}, \code{"boxplot"}, \code{"vlnplot"}, and \code{"ridgeplot"}.
Each plot type has specific associated options which are controlled by variables that start with their associated string, ex: \code{jitter.size}.

Inclusion of \code{"ridgeplot"} overrides boxplot and violin plot and changes the plot to be horizontal.

If \code{add.line}, is provided a single or multiple value(s), horizontal (or vertical, for ridgeplots) lines will be added at the values provided.
Linetype and color are set with \code{line.linetype}, which is "dashed" by default, and \code{line.color}, which is "black" by default.

\examples{
library(Seurat)
pbmc <- Seurat::pbmc_small

# Pick a set of genes
genes <- get.genes("pbmc")[1:30]

dittoPlotVarsAcrossGroups(
    genes, object = pbmc,
    group.by = "RNA_snn_res.1")

# Color can be controlled separately from grouping with 'color.by'
#   Just note: all groupings must map to a single color.
dittoPlotVarsAcrossGroups(
    genes, object = pbmc,
    group.by = "RNA_snn_res.1",
    color.by = "orig.ident")

# To change it to have the violin plot in the back, a jitter on
#  top of that, and a white boxplot with no fill in front:
dittoPlotVarsAcrossGroups(
    genes, object = "pbmc",
    group.by = "RNA_snn_res.1", color.by = "RNA_snn_res.1",
    plots = c("vlnplot","jitter","boxplot"),
    boxplot.color = "white", boxplot.fill = FALSE)

# To investigate the identities of outlier genes, we can turn on hovering
dittoPlotVarsAcrossGroups(
    genes, object = "pbmc",
    group.by = "RNA_snn_res.1",
    do.hover = TRUE)
